# JavaScript Drum Kit

## Description

This is the first exercise in the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 challenge. The goal was to play specific sounds for the different key strokes and display a brief animation to indicate which button was pressed.

- My motivation was to continue to build my skillset
- This exercise covers adding and removing classes in a way that is easy to maintain.
- The biggest challenge I faced was identifying minor typos in my code.

## Usage

When the indicated keys are pressed, the associated audio file plays and the key is highlighted as indicated in the image below. When the transition ends the class is removed and the effect goes away.
